		"abstract": "Summary\nAssociative learning is an essential brain process where the contingency of different items increases after training. Associative learning has been found to occur in many brain regions [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, there is no clear evidence that associative learning of visual features occurs in early visual areas, although a number of studies have indicated that learning of a single visual feature (perceptual learning) involves early visual areas [5, 6, 7, 8]. Here, via decoded fMRI neurofeedback termed “DecNef” [9], we tested whether associative learning of orientation and color can be created in early visual areas. During 3 days of training, DecNef induced fMRI signal patterns that corresponded to a specific target color (red) mostly in early visual areas while a vertical achromatic grating was physically presented to participants. As a result, participants came to perceive “red” significantly more frequently than “green” in an achromatic vertical grating. This effect was also observed 3–5 months after the training. These results suggest that long-term associative learning of two different visual features such as orientation and color was created, most likely in early visual areas. This newly extended technique that induces associative learning is called “A-DecNef,” and it may be used as an important tool for understanding and modifying brain functions because associations are fundamental and ubiquitous functions in the brain.",

The NF signals of traditional rtfMRI-NF studies predominantly reflect neuronal activity within ROIs. In this study, we describe a novel rtfMRI-NF approach that includes a functional connectivity (FC) component in the NF signal (FC-added rtfMRI-NF). We estimated the efficacy of the FC-added rtfMRI-NF method by applying it to nicotine-dependent heavy smokers in an effort to reduce cigarette craving. ACC and medial pFC as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus are associated with cigarette craving and were chosen as ROIs. Fourteen heavy smokers were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of NF: traditional activity-based rtfMRI-NF or FC-added rtfMRI-NF. Participants received rtfMRI-NF training during two separate visits after overnight smoking cessation, and cigarette craving score was assessed. The FC-added rtfMRI-NF resulted in greater neuronal activity and increased FC between the targeted ROIs than the traditional activity-based rtfMRI-NF and resulted in lower craving score. In the FC-added rtfMRI-NF condition, the average of neuronal activity and FC was tightly associated with craving score (Bonferroni-corrected p = .028). However, in the activity-based rtfMRI-NF condition, no association was detected (uncorrected p > .081). Non-rtfMRI data analysis also showed enhanced neuronal activity and FC with FC-added NF than with activity-based NF. These results demonstrate that FC-added rtfMRI-NF facilitates greater volitional control over brain activity and connectivity and greater modulation of mental function than activity-based rtfMRI-NF.",

		"abstract": "Numerous research groups are now using analysis of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results and relaying back information about regional activity in their brains to participants in the scanner in ‘real time’. In this study, we explored the feasibility of self-regulation of frontal cortical activation using real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback in nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers during exposure to smoking cues. Ten cigarette smokers were shown smoking-related visual cues in a 3 Tesla MRI scanner to induce their nicotine craving. Participants were instructed to modify their craving using rtfMRI feedback with two different approaches. In a ‘reduce craving’ paradigm, participants were instructed to ‘reduce’ their craving, and decrease the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity. In a separate ‘increase resistance’ paradigm, participants were asked to increase their resistance to craving and to increase middle prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity. We found that participants were able to significantly reduce the BOLD signal in the ACC during the ‘reduce craving’ task (P = 0.028). There was a significant correlation between decreased ACC activation and reduced craving ratings during the ‘reduce craving’ session (P = 0.011). In contrast, there was no modulation of the BOLD signal in mPFC during the ‘increase resistance’ session. These preliminary results suggest that some smokers may be able to use neurofeedback via rtfMRI to voluntarily regulate ACC activation and temporarily reduce smoking cue-induced craving. Further research is needed to determine the optimal parameters of neurofeedback rtfMRI, and whether it might eventually become a therapeutic tool for nicotine dependence.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was the analysis of the effect of a learned increase in the dissociation between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the left posterior insula (pInsL) on pain intensity and unpleasantness and the contribution of each region to the effect, exploring the possibility to influence the perception of pain with neurofeedback methods. We trained ten healthy subjects to increase the difference in the blood oxygenation level-dependent response between the rACC and pInsL to painful electric stimuli. Subjects learned to increase the dissociation with either the rACC (state 1) or the pInsL (state 2) being higher. For feedback we subtracted the signal of one region from the other and provided feedback in four conditions with six trials each yielding two different states: (rACC – pInsL increase (state 1), rACC – pInsL decrease (state 2), pInsL – rACC increase (state 2), pInsL – rACC decrease (state 1)). Significant changes in the dissociation from trial one to six were seen in all conditions. There were significant changes from trial one to six in the pInsL in three of the four conditions, the rACC showed no significant change. Pain intensity or unpleasantness ratings were unrelated to the dissociation between the regions and the activation in each region. Learning success in the conditions did not significantly correlate and there was no significant correlation between the two respective conditions of one state, i.e. learning to achieve a specific state is not a stable ability. The pInsL seems to be the driving force behind changes in the learned dissociation between the regions. Despite successful differential modulation of activation in areas responsive to the painful stimulus, no corresponding changes in the perception of pain intensity or unpleasantness emerged. Learning to induce different states of dissociation between the areas is not a stable ability since success did not correlate overall or between two conditions of the the same state.",

		"abstract": "Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) is a novel technique that has allowed subjects to achieve self-regulation of circumscribed brain regions. Despite its anticipated therapeutic benefits, there is no report on successful application of this technique in psychiatric populations. The objectives of the present study were to train schizophrenia patients to achieve volitional control of bilateral anterior insula cortex on multiple days, and to explore the effect of learned self-regulation on face emotion recognition (an extensively studied deficit in schizophrenia) and on brain network connectivity. Nine patients with schizophrenia were trained to regulate the hemodynamic response in bilateral anterior insula with contingent rtfMRI neurofeedback, through a 2-weeks training. At the end of the training stage, patients performed a face emotion recognition task to explore behavioral effects of learned self-regulation. A learning effect in self-regulation was found for bilateral anterior insula, which persisted through the training. Following successful self-regulation, patients recognized disgust faces more accurately and happy faces less accurately. Improvements in disgust recognition were correlated with levels of self-activation of right insula. RtfMRI training led to an increase in the number of the incoming and outgoing effective connections of the anterior insula. This study shows for the first time that patients with schizophrenia can learn volitional brain regulation by rtfMRI feedback training leading to changes in the perception of emotions and modulations of the brain network connectivity. These findings open the door for further studies of rtfMRI in severely ill psychiatric populations, and possible therapeutic applications. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

		"abstract": "Obesity is associated with altered responses to food stimuli in prefrontal brain networks that mediate inhibitory control of ingestive behavior. In particular, activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is reduced in obese compared to normal-weight subjects and has been linked to the success of weight-loss dietary interventions. In a randomized controlled trial in overweight/obese subjects, we investigated the effect on eating behavior of volitional up-regulation of dlPFC activity via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training. Thirty-eight overweight or obese subjects (BMI 25–40 kg/m2) took part in fMRI neurofeedback training with the aim of increasing activity of the left dlPFC (dlPFC group; n = 17) or of the visual cortex (VC/control group; n = 21). Participants were blinded to group assignment. The training session took place on a single day and included three training runs of six trials of up-regulation and passive viewing. Food appraisal and snack intake were assessed at screening, after training, and in a follow-up session four weeks later. Participants of both groups succeeded in up-regulating activity of the targeted brain area. However, participants of the control group also showed increased left dlPFC activity during up-regulation. Functional connectivity between dlPFC and ventromedial PFC, an area that processes food value, was generally increased during up-regulation compared to passive viewing. At follow-up compared to baseline, both groups rated pictures of high-, but not low-calorie foods as less palatable and chose them less frequently. Actual snack intake remained unchanged but palatability and choice ratings for chocolate cookies decreased after training. We demonstrate that one session of fMRI neurofeedback training enables individuals with increased body weight to up-regulate activity of the left dlPFC. Behavioral effects were observed in both groups, which might have been due to dlPFC co-activation in the control group and, in addition, unspecific training effects. Improved dlPFC-vmPFC functional connectivity furthermore suggested enhanced food intake-related control mechanisms. Neurofeedback training might support therapeutic strategies aiming at improved self-control in obesity, although the respective contributions of area-specific mechanisms and general regulation effects are in need of further investigation.",

		"container-title": "NeuroImage",
		"source": "ScienceDirect",
		"abstract": "The triple networks, namely the default-mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN), and the salience network (SN), play crucial roles in disorders of the brain, as well as in basic neuroscientific processes such as mindfulness. However, currently, there is no consensus on the underlying functional features of the triple networks associated with mindfulness. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that (a) the partial regression coefficient (i.e., slope): from the SN to the DMN, mediated by the CEN, would be one of the potential mindfulness features in the real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) setting, and (b) this slope level may be enhanced by rtfMRI-NF training. Sixty healthy mindfulness-naïve males participated in an MRI session consisting of two non-rtfMRI-runs, followed by two rtfMRI-NF runs and one transfer run. Once the regions-of-interest of each of the triple networks were defined using the non-rtfMRI-runs, the slope level was calculated by mediation analysis and used as neurofeedback information, in the form of a thermometer bar, to assist with participant mindfulness during the rtfMRI-NF runs. The participants were asked to increase the level of the thermometer bar while deploying a mindfulness strategy, which consisted of focusing attention on the physical sensations of breathing. rtfMRI-NF training was conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial design, in which participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The participants in the experimental group received contingent neurofeedback information, which was obtained from their own brain signals, whereas the participants in the control group received non-contingent neurofeedback information that originated from matched participants in the experimental group. Our results indicated that the slope level from the SN to the DMN, mediated by the CEN, was associated with mindfulness score (rtfMRI-NF runs: r = 0.53, p = 0.007; p-value was corrected from 10,000 random permutations) and with task-performance feedback score (rtfMRI-NF run: r = 0.61, p = 0.001) in the experimental group only. In addition, during the rtfMRI-NF runs the level of the partial regression coefficient feature was substantially increased in the experimental group compared to the control group (p < 0.05 from the paired t-test; the p-value was corrected from 10,000 random permutations). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a partial regression coefficient feature of mindfulness in the rtfMRI-NF setting obtained by triple network mediation analysis, as well as the possibility of enhancement of the partial regression coefficient feature by rtfMRI-NF training.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThe experience of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia is associated with changes in brain network function. In particular, studies indicate altered functional coupling between nodes of the language and default mode networks. Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can be used to modulate such aberrant network connectivity.\nMethods\nWe investigated resting-state connectivity changes after neurofeedback (NF) in 21 patients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals. All participants underwent two days of neurofeedback training of important nodes of the left-hemispheric language network including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, participants learned to down- and up-regulate their brain activation in the designated target regions based on NF. Prior to and after each training day, a resting state measurement took place.\nResults\nCoupling between nodes of the language and the default mode network (DMN) selectively increased after down-as compared to up-regulation NF. Network analyses revealed more pronounced increases in functional connectivity between nodes of the language network and the DMN in patients compared to healthy individuals. In particular, down-regulation NF led to increased coupling between nodes of the language network and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL) as well as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in patients. Up-regulation strengthened connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Improved well-being four weeks after the training predicted increased functional coupling between the left IFG and left IPL.\nConclusion\nModulatory effects emerged as increased internetwork communication, indicating that down-regulation NF selectively enhances coupling between language and DM network nodes in patients with AVH. RtfMRI NF may thus be used to modulate brain network function that is relevant to the phenomenology of AVH. Specific effects of self-regulation on symptom improvement have to be explored in therapeutic interventions.",

		"abstract": "Recent findings have been challenging current understanding about how fast the human brain change its structural and functional connections in response to training. One powerful way to deepen the inner workings of human brain plasticity is using neurofeedback (NFB) by fMRI, a technique that allows self-induced brain plasticity by means of modulating brain activity in real time. In the present randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled study, we use NFB to train healthy individuals to reinforce brain patterns related to motor execution while performing a motor imagery task, with no overt movement. After 1 h of NFB training, participants displayed increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the sensorimotor segment of corpus callosum and increased functional connectivity of the sensorimotor resting state network. Increased functional connectivity was also observed in default mode network. These results were not observed in the control group, which was trained with sham feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of white matter FA changes following a very short training schedule (<1 h). Our results suggest that NFB by fMRI can be an interesting tool to explore dynamic aspects of brain plasticity and open new venues for investigating brain plasticity in healthy individuals and in neurological conditions.",

		"source": "Frontiers",
		"abstract": "One of the most prominent symptoms in addiction disorders is the strong desire to consume a particular substance or to show a certain behaviour (craving). The strong association between craving and the probability of relapse emphasises the importance of craving in the therapeutic process. Former studies have demonstrated that neuromodulation using real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) can be used as a treatment modality in patients with tobacco use disorder. The aim of the present project was to determine whether it is possible to predict the outcome of NF training plus group psychotherapy at the beginning of the treatment. For that purpose, neuronal responses during the first rtfMRI NF session of patients who remained abstinent for at least three months were compared to those of patients with relapse. All patients were included in a certified smoke-free course and took part in three NF sessions. During the rtfMRI NF sessions tobacco-associated and neutral pictures were presented. Subjects were instructed to reduce their neuronal responses during the presentation of smoking cues in an individualised region of interest for craving (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Patients were stratified to different groups (abstinence [N=10] vs. relapse [N=12]) according to their individual smoking status three months after the rtfMRI NF training. A direct comparison of BOLD responses during the first NF-session of patients who had remained abstinent over three months after the NF training and patients who had relapsed after three months showed that patients of the relapse group demonstrated enhanced BOLD responses, especially in the ACC, the supplementary motor area as well as dorsolateral prefrontal areas, compared to abstinent patients. These results suggest that there is a probability of estimating a successful withdrawal in patients with tobacco use disorder by analysing the first rtfMRI NF session: a pronounced reduction of frontal responses during NF training in patients might be the functional correlate of better therapeutic success. The results of the first NF sessions could be useful as predictor whether a patient will be able to achieve success after the behavioural group therapy and NF training in quitting smoking or not.",

		"abstract": "During brain modulation, repeated mental practice may not always result in efficient learning. Particularly, the effectiveness of mental motor practice depends on how well one induces neural activity in a desired state consistently across mental trials, which calls for feedbacks to adjust one's performance. We hypothesized that even a brief experience of neurofeedback learning enhances trial-by-trial neural pattern consistency during subsequent mental motor execution and that this experience would change recruitment of functional connectivity in the motor imagery and default mode networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with two sessions of mental motor practice before and after a neurofeedback training session, in which participants conducted four types of first-person mental motor execution tasks (walking forward, turning left, turning right, and touching a tree). During the neurofeedback training session, in which participants conducted a virtual navigation game, 10 experimental participants received real-time fMRI neuro-feedbacks, while 10 control participants simply repeated the same mental task according to given cues without feedbacks. The experimental group showed significantly higher effects of neuro-feedback training on trial-by-trial consistencies and classification accuracies of activated neural patterns than the control group. Task-performing global node strength and network efficiency were increased in the motor imagery network but decreased in the default mode network only in the experimental group. These results demonstrate that even a brief experience of feedback learning is more effective than simple practice repetitions without evaluation, which was reflected in increased neural pattern consistency and task-dependent functional connectivity during a mental motor execution task.",

		"source": "ScienceDirect",
		"abstract": "The superior temporal sulcus (STS) encompasses a complex set of regions involved in a wide range of cognitive functions. To understand its functional properties, neuromodulation approaches such brain stimulation or neurofeedback can be used. We investigated whether the posterior STS (pSTS), a core region in the face perception and imagery network, could be specifically identified based on the presence of dynamic facial expressions (and not just on simple motion or static face signals), and probed with neurofeedback. Recognition of facial expressions is critically impaired in autism spectrum disorder, making this region a relevant target for future clinical neurofeedback studies. We used a stringent localizer approach based on the contrast of dynamic facial expressions against static neutral faces plus moving dots. The target region had to be specifically responsive to dynamic facial expressions instead of mere motion and/or the presence of a static face. The localizer was successful in selecting this region across subjects. Neurofeedback was then performed, using this region as a target, with two novel feedback rules (mean or derivative-based, using visual or auditory interfaces). Our results provide evidence that a facial expression-selective cluster in pSTS can be identified and may represent a suitable target for neurofeedback approaches, aiming at social and emotional cognition. These findings highlight the presence of a highly selective region in STS encoding dynamic aspects of facial expressions. Future studies should elucidate its role as a mechanistic target for neurofeedback strategies in clinical disorders of social cognition such as autism.",

		"source": "Springer Link",
		"abstract": "Motor imagery of movements is used as mental strategy in neurofeedback applications to gain voluntary control over activity in motor areas of the brain. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we first addressed the question whether motor imagery and execution of swallowing activate comparable brain areas, which has been already proven for hand and foot movements. Prior near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies provide evidence that this is the case in the outer layer of the cortex. With the present fMRI study, we want to expand these prior NIRS findings to the whole brain. Second, we used motor imagery of swallowing as mental strategy during visual neurofeedback to investigate whether one can learn to modulate voluntarily activity in brain regions, which are associated with active swallowing, using real-time fMRI. Eleven healthy adults performed one offline session, in which they executed swallowing movements and imagined swallowing on command during fMRI scanning. Based on this functional localizer task, we identified brain areas active during both tasks and defined individually regions for feedback. During the second session, participants performed two real-time fMRI neurofeedback runs (each run comprised 10 motor imagery trials), in which they should increase voluntarily the activity in the left precentral gyrus by means of motor imagery of swallowing while receiving visual feedback (the visual feedback depicted one’s own fMRI signal changes in real-time). Motor execution and imagery of swallowing activated a comparable network of brain areas including the bilateral pre- and postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, insula, SMA, and the cerebellum compared to a resting condition. During neurofeedback training, participants were able to increase the activity in the feedback region (left lateral precentral gyrus) but also in other brain regions, which are generally active during swallowing, compared to the motor imagery offline task. Our results indicate that motor imagery of swallowing is an adequate mental strategy to activate the swallowing network of the whole brain, which might be useful for future treatments of swallowing disorders.",

We sought to determine whether real-time fMRI neurofeedback training is feasible in Huntington's disease (HD), and assess any factors that contribute to its effectiveness. In this proof-of-concept study, we used this technique to train 10 patients with HD to volitionally regulate the activity of their supplementary motor area (SMA). We collected detailed behavioral and neuroimaging data before and after training to examine changes of brain function and structure, and cognitive and motor performance. We found that patients overall learned to increase activity of the target region during training with variable effects on cognitive and motor behavior. Improved cognitive and motor performance after training predicted increases in pre-SMA grey matter volume, fMRI activity in the left putamen, and increased SMA–left putamen functional connectivity. Although we did not directly target the putamen and corticostriatal connectivity during neurofeedback training, our results suggest that training the SMA can lead to regulation of associated networks with beneficial effects in behavior. We conclude that neurofeedback training can induce plasticity in patients with Huntington's disease despite the presence of neurodegeneration, and the effects of training a single region may engage other regions and circuits implicated in disease pathology.",

		"abstract": "Real-time fMRI neurofeedback is a feasible tool to learn the volitional regulation of brain activity. So far, most studies provide continuous feedback information that is presented upon every volume acquisition. Although this maximizes the temporal resolution of feedback information, it may be accompanied by some disadvantages. Participants can be distracted from the regulation task due to (1) the intrinsic delay of the hemodynamic response and associated feedback and (2) limited cognitive resources available to simultaneously evaluate feedback information and stay engaged with the task. Here, we systematically investigate differences between groups presented with different variants of feedback (continuous vs. intermittent) and a control group receiving no feedback on their ability to regulate amygdala activity using positive memories and feelings. In contrast to the feedback groups, no learning effect was observed in the group without any feedback presentation. The group receiving intermittent feedback exhibited better amygdala regulation performance when compared with the group receiving continuous feedback. Behavioural measurements show that these effects were reflected in differences in task engagement. Overall, we not only demonstrate that the presentation of feedback is a prerequisite to learn volitional control of amygdala activity but also that intermittent feedback is superior to continuous feedback presentation.",

We applied this approach to study correlations between thalamic BOLD activity and alpha EEG rhythm. Healthy volunteers in the experimental group (EG, n = 15) learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the target region consisting of the mediodorsal (MD) and anterior (AN) thalamic nuclei using rtfMRI-nf during retrieval of happy autobiographical memories. Healthy subjects in the control group (CG, n = 14) were provided with a sham feedback. The EG participants were able to significantly increase BOLD activities of the MD and AN. Functional connectivity between the MD and the inferior precuneus was significantly enhanced during the rtfMRI-nf task. Average individual changes in the occipital alpha EEG power significantly correlated with the average MD BOLD activity levels for the EG. Temporal correlations between the occipital alpha EEG power and BOLD activities of the MD and AN were significantly enhanced, during the rtfMRI-nf task, for the EG compared to the CG. Temporal correlations with the alpha power were also significantly enhanced for the posterior nodes of the default mode network, including the precuneus/posterior cingulate, and for the dorsal striatum. Our findings suggest that the temporal correlation between the MD BOLD activity and posterior alpha EEG power is modulated by the interaction between the MD and the inferior precuneus, reflected in their functional connectivity. Our results demonstrate the potential of the rtfMRI-nf with simultaneous EEG for noninvasive neuromodulation studies of human brain function.",

		"abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, n = 20) learned to upregulate blood‑oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity of the left amygdala (LA) using the rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG, n = 11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI. PTSD severity was assessed before and after the training using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). The EG participants who completed the study showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings, including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms. They also exhibited a significant reduction in comorbid depression severity. Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. No significant difference in the CAPS rating changes was observed between the groups. During the first rtfMRI-nf session, functional connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this enhancement significantly and positively correlated with the initial CAPS ratings. Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a significant positive correlation with the initial CAPS. Reduction in PTSD severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC. Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity has the potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity deficiencies specific to PTSD.",

		"abstract": "The present work assessed the efficacy of training volitional down-regulation of the primary auditory cortex (A1) based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NFT). A1 has been shown to be hyperactive in chronic tinnitus patients, and has been implicated as a potential source for the tinnitus percept. 27 healthy volunteers with normal hearing underwent 5 fMRI-NFT sessions: 18 received real neurofeedback and 9 sham neurofeedback. Each session was composed of a simple auditory fMRI followed by 2 runs of A1 fMRI-NFT. The auditory fMRI alternated periods of no auditory with periods of white noise stimulation at 90 dB. A1 activity, defined from a region using the activity during the preceding auditory run, was continuously updated during fMRI-NFT using a simple bar plot, and was accompanied by white noise (90 dB) stimulation for the duration of the scan. Each fMRI-NFT run alternated “relax” periods with “lower” periods. Subjects were instructed to watch the bar during the relax condition and actively reduce the bar by decreasing A1 activation during the lower condition. Average A1 de-activation, representative of the ability to volitionally down-regulate A1, was extracted from each fMRI-NFT run. A1 de-activation was found to increase significantly across training and to be higher in those receiving real neurofeedback. A1 de-activation in sessions 2 and 5 were found to be significantly greater than session 1 in only the group receiving real neurofeedback. The most successful subjects reportedly adopted mindfulness tasks associated with directed attention. For the first time, fMRI-NFT has been applied to teach volitional control of A1 de-activation magnitude over more than 1 session. These are important findings for therapeutic development as the magnitude of A1 activity is altered in tinnitus populations and it is unlikely a single fMRI-NFT session will reverse the effects of tinnitus.",

		"abstract": "To benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), individuals must not only learn new skills but also strategically implement them outside of session. Here, we tested a novel technique for personalizing CBT skills and facilitating their generalization to daily life. We hypothesized that showing participants the impact of specific CBT strategies on their own brain function using real-time functional magnetic imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback would increase their metacognitive awareness, help them identify effective strategies, and motivate real-world use. In a within-subjects design, participants who had completed a clinical trial of a standardized course of CBT created a personal repertoire of negative autobiographical stimuli and mood regulation strategies. From each participant's repertoire, a set of experimental and control strategies were identified; only experimental strategies were practiced in the scanner. During the rt-fMRI neurofeedback session, participants used negative stimuli and strategies from their repertoire to manipulate activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in emotional distress. The primary outcome measures were changes in participant ratings of strategy difficulty, efficacy, and frequency of use. As predicted, ratings for unscanned control strategies were stable across observations, whereas ratings for experimental strategies changed after neurofeedback. At follow-up one month after the session, efficacy and frequency ratings for scanned strategies were predicted by neurofeedback during the rt-fMRI session. These results suggest that rt-fMRI neurofeedback created a salient and durable learning experience for patients, extending beyond the scan session to guide and motivate CBT skill use weeks later. This metacognitive approach to neurofeedback offers a promising model for increasing clinical benefits from cognitive behavioral therapy by personalizing skills and facilitating generalization.",

		"abstract": "Neurofeedback (NFB) enables the voluntary regulation of brain activity, with promising applications to enhance and recover emotion and cognitive processes, and the underlying neurobiology. It remains unclear whether NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB procedure. With rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to have a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by participants’ preferred personalized strategies to maximize the intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach appeared technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary modulation. Via changing the color of the virtual environment BCI during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the activity of the septo-hypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI based rtfMRI-NFB, and correctly matched patterns of brain activity to those classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM based rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral prefrontal and additional regions ascribed to negative affect. These findings were robust appeared at the individual subject level, reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during rtfMRI-NFB and were observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the two sites. This multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol holds promise as an engaging tool for brain-based interventions to enhance adaptive emotional states in normative samples and restore normal states in psychopathologies associated with anxiety, stress or reduced empathy.",

		"abstract": "Background. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by deficits in the self-regulation of cognitions and emotions. Neural networks of emotion regulation may exhibit reduced control mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), contributing to aberrant limbic responses in PTSD. Methods. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NF) assessed self-regulation of the ACC in nine patients with PTSD after single trauma exposure and nine matched healthy controls. All participants were instructed to train ACC upregulation on three training days. Results. Both groups achieved regulation, which was associated with wide-spread brain activation encompassing the ACC. Compared to the controls, regulation amplitude and learning rate was lower in patients, correlating with symptom severity. In addition, a frontopolar activation cluster was associated with self-regulation efforts in patients. Conclusions. For the first time, we tested self-regulation of the ACC in patients with PTSD. The observed impairment supports models of ACC-mediated regulation deficits that may contribute to the psychopathology of PTSD. Controlled trials in a larger sample are needed to confirm our findings and to directly investigate whether training of central regulation mechanisms improves emotion regulation in PTSD.",

		"abstract": "Motor imagery (MI), a covert cognitive process where an action is mentally simulated but not actually performed, could be used as an effective neurorehabilitation tool for motor function improvement or recovery. Recent approaches employing brain-computer/brain-machine interfaces to provide online feedback of the MI during rehabilitation training have promising rehabilitation outcomes. In this study, we examined whether participants could volitionally recall MI-related brain activation patterns when guided using neurofeedback (NF) during training. The participants’ performance was compared to that without NF. We hypothesized that participants would be able to consistently generate the relevant activation pattern associated with the MI task during training with NF compared to that without NF. To assess activation consistency, we used the performance of classifiers trained to discriminate MI-related brain activation patterns. Our results showed significantly higher predictive values of MI-related activation patterns during training with NF. Additionally, this improvement in the classification performance tends to be associated with the activation of middle temporal gyrus/inferior occipital gyrus, a region associated with visual motion processing, suggesting the importance of performance monitoring during MI task training. Taken together, these findings suggest that the efficacy of MI training, in terms of generating consistent brain activation patterns relevant to the task, can be enhanced by using NF as a mechanism to enable participants to volitionally recall task-related brain activation patterns.",

Using realtime fMRI, we implemented an online ‘winner-takes-all approach’ with quadrant-specific parameter estimates, to achieve single-block classification of brain activations. These were linked to the covert allocation of attention to real-world images presented at 4-quadrant locations. Accuracies in three target regions were significantly above chance, with individual decoding accuracies reaching upto 70%. By utilising higher order mental processes, ‘cognitive BCIs’ access varied and therefore more versatile information, potentially providing a platform for communication in patients who are unable to speak or move due to brain injury.",

		"abstract": "It has been postulated that gaining control over activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region of the working memory brain network, may be beneficial for cognitive performance and treatment of certain psychiatric disorders. Several studies have reported that, with neurofeedback training, subjects can learn to increase DLPFC activity. However, improvement of dynamic control in terms of switching between low and high activity in DLPFC brain states may potentially constitute more effective self-regulation. Here, we report on feasibility of obtaining dynamic control over DLPFC, meaning the ability to both in- and decrease activity at will, within a single functional MRI scan session. Two groups of healthy volunteers (N = 24) were asked to increase and decrease activity in the left DLPFC as often as possible during fMRI scans (at 7 Tesla), while receiving real-time visual feedback. The experimental group practiced with real-time feedback, whereas the control group received sham feedback. The experimental group significantly increased the speed of intentionally alternating DLPFC activity, while performance of the control group did not change. Analysis of the characteristics of the BOLD signal during successful trials revealed that training with neurofeedback predominantly reduced the time for the DLPFC to return to baseline after activation. These results provide a preliminary indication that people may be able to learn to dynamically down-regulate the level of physiological activity in the DLPFC, and may have implications for psychiatric disorders where DLPFC plays a role.",

		"abstract": "Background\nEnhanced drug-related reward sensitivity accompanied by impaired sensitivity to non-drug related rewards in the mesolimbic dopamine system are thought to underlie the broad motivational deficits and dysfunctional decision-making frequently observed in cocaine use disorder (CUD). Effective approaches to modify this imbalance and reinstate non-drug reward responsiveness are urgently needed. Here, we examined whether cocaine users (CU) can use mental imagery of non-drug rewards to self-regulate the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (VTA/SN). We expected that obsessive and compulsive thoughts about cocaine consumption would hamper the ability to self-regulate the VTA/SN activity and tested if real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NFB) can improve self-regulation of the VTA/SN.\nMethods\nTwenty-two CU and 28 healthy controls (HC) were asked to voluntarily up-regulate VTA/SN activity with non-drug reward imagery alone, or combined with rtfMRI NFB.\nResults\nOn a group level, HC and CU were able to activate the dopaminergic midbrain and other reward regions with reward imagery. In CU, the individual ability to self-regulate the VTA/SN was reduced in those with more severe obsessive-compulsive drug use. NFB enhanced the effect of reward imagery but did not result in transfer effects at the end of the session.\nConclusion\nCU can voluntary activate their reward system with non-drug reward imagery and improve this ability with rtfMRI NFB. Combining mental imagery and rtFMRI NFB has great potential for modifying the maladapted reward sensitivity and reinstating non-drug reward responsiveness. This motivates further work to examine the use of rtfMRI NFB in the treatment of CUD.",

		"abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Deficient emotion regulation and exaggerated anxiety represent a major transdiagnostic psychopathological marker. On the neural level these deficits have been closely linked to impaired, yet treatment-sensitive, prefrontal regulatory control over the amygdala. Gaining direct control over these pathways could therefore provide an innovative and promising intervention to regulate exaggerated anxiety. To this end the current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-informed real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In a randomized crossover sham-controlled design, 26 healthy subjects with high anxiety underwent real-time fMRI-guided neurofeedback training to enhance connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the amygdala (target pathway) during threat exposure. Maintenance of regulatory control was assessed after 3 days and in the absence of feedback. Training-induced changes in functional connectivity of the target pathway and anxiety ratings served as primary outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Training of the target, yet not the sham control, pathway significantly increased amygdala-vlPFC connectivity and decreased levels of anxiety. Stronger connectivity increases were significantly associated with higher anxiety reduction on the group level. At the follow-up, volitional control over the target pathway was maintained in the absence of feedback. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The present results demonstrate for the first time that successful self-regulation of amygdala-prefrontal top-down regulatory circuits may represent a novel intervention to control anxiety. As such, the present findings underscore both the critical contribution of amygdala-prefrontal circuits to emotion regulation and the therapeutic potential of connectivity-informed real-time neurofeedback.",

		"abstract": "There is increasing interest in exploring the use of functional MRI neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) as a therapeutic technique for a range of neurological conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD). One main therapeutic potential of fMRI-NF is to enhance volitional control of damaged or dysfunctional neural nodes and networks via a closed-loop feedback model using mental imagery as the catalyst of self-regulation. The choice of target node/network and direction of regulation (increase or decrease activity) are central design considerations in fMRI-NF studies. Whilst it remains unclear whether the primary motor cortex (M1) can be activated during motor imagery, the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been robustly activated during motor imagery. Such differences in the regulation potential between primary and supplementary motor cortex are important because these areas can be differentially affected by a stroke or PD, and the choice of fMRI-NF target and grade of self-regulation of activity likely have substantial influence on the clinical effects and cost effectiveness of NF-based interventions. In this study we therefore investigated firstly whether healthy subjects would be able to achieve self-regulation of the hand-representation areas of M1 and the SMA using fMRI-NF training. There was a significant decrease in M1 neural activity during fMRI-NF, whereas SMA neural activity was increased, albeit not with the predicated graded effect. This study has important implications for fMRI-NF protocols that employ motor imagery to modulate activity in specific target regions of the brain and to determine how they may be tailored for neurorehabilitation.",

		"abstract": "Being in control of one's emotions is not only desirable in many everyday situations but is also a great challenge in a variety of mental disorders. Successful intentional emotion regulation is related to down-regulation of amygdala activity. Training mental interventions supported by neurofeedback of one's own amygdala activity using real-time (rt-)fMRI might be beneficial for mental health and well-being. Rt-fMRI guided amygdala-downregulation using cognitive interventions such as a “reality check”, however, have not been well-investigated. Fifteen healthy subjects underwent four rt-fMRI sessions with neurofeedback of their own amygdala activity while applying a reality check as an emotion regulation strategy in order to down-regulate their amygdala signal during a stimulation with emotional pictures. The Control group comprised of eleven subjects also trained emotion regulation but without obtaining feedback. We hypothesized more prominent down-regulation of amygdala activity at the end of the training in the Feedback group. We investigated effects over time and between groups and further task specific connectivity of the amygdala by using psychophysiological interaction analyses. Four weekly amygdala-based feedback sessions resulted in significantly decreased amygdala activity (p = 0.003, d = 0.93), also compared to the Control group (p = 0.014, d = 1.12). Task specific connectivity of the amygdala with the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and distinct prefrontal areas was increased in the Feedback group. Training of emotion regulation supported by rt-fMRI neurofeedback resulted in a prominent amygdala down-regulation compared to training without feedback. The finding implicates successful emotion regulation, compliant with emotion control models, through an easily applicable reality check strategy. Rt-fMRI neurofeedback may support emotion regulation learning and bears clinical potential for psychotherapy.",

		"abstract": "Intentional movement is an internally driven process that requires the integration of motivational and sensory cues with motor preparedness. In addition to the motor cortical-basal ganglia circuits, the limbic circuits are also involved in the integration of these cues. Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have a particular difficulty with internally-generating intentional movements and maintaining the speed, size, and vigor of movements. This difficulty improves when they are provided with external cues suggesting that there is a problem with the internal motivation of movement in PD. The prevailing view attributes this difficulty in PD to the dysfunction of motor cortical-basal ganglia circuits. First, we argue that the standard cortical-basal ganglia circuit model of motor dysfunction in PD needs to be expanded to include the insula which is a major hub within the limbic circuits. We propose a neural circuit model highlighting the interaction between the insula and dorsomedial frontal cortex which is involved in generating intentional movements. The insula processes a wide range of sensory signals arising from the body and integrates them with the emotional and motivational context. In doing so, it provides the impetus to the dorsomedial frontal cortex to initiate and sustain movement. Second, we present the results of our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating that the functional connectivity of the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex circuit can be enhanced with neurofeedback-guided kinesthetic motor imagery using functional magnetic resonance imaging in subjects with PD. Specifically, we found that the intensity and quality of body sensations evoked during motor imagery and the emotional and motivational context of motor imagery determined the direction (i.e., negative or positive) of the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity. After 10-12 neurofeedback sessions and “off-line” practice of the successful motor imagery strategies all subjects showed a significant increase in the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results regarding motor function in patients with PD and propose suggestions for future studies.",

		"abstract": "The amygdala plays an important role in emotion processing. Several studies have proved that its activation can be regulated by real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI)-based neurofeedback training. However, although studies have found brain regions that are functionallycloselyconnectedto the amygdala in the cortex, it is not clear whether these brain regions and the amygdala are structurally closely connected, and if they show the same training effect as the amygdala in the process of emotional regulation. In this paper, we instructed subjects to up-regulate the activation of the left amygdala (LA) through rtfMRI-based neurofeedback training. In order to fuse multimodal imaging data, we introduced a network analysis method called the λ-Louvain clustering algorithm. This method was used to integrate multimodal data from the training experiment and construct an LA-cortical network. Correlation analysis and main-effect analysis were conducted to determine the signal covariance associated with the activation of the target area; ultimately, we identified the left temporal pole superior as the amygdaloidal-cortical network region. As a deep nucleus in the brain, the treatment and stimulation of the amygdala remains challenging. Our results provide new insights for the regulation of activation in a deep nucleus using more neurofeedback techniques.",
